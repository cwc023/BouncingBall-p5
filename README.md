# BouncingBall-p5
This is a test website to host a p5 project that I just recently learned, mostly from Prof Xiannong Meng. 
My p5js editor for this repository [https://editor.p5js.org/cwc023/sketches/jA0MYndDy]. Below is a screenshot of the program.
Note the program actually generates a video the 2D circles rotate around a torus going in and out of the frame.

The website that runs the program is at [https://github.com/cwc023.github.io/BouncingBall-p5]
